Challenge 3: Exploring genetic variation in motor neurone disease longevity to inform drug discovery.

Brief description: Recent genome-wide association study findings highlight the genetic component of motor neurone disease. Fifteen risk loci with distinct genetic architectures and neuron-specific biology provide vital clues to inform future drug discovery. This challenge will explore potential mechanisms and drug targets linked to these new findings.
